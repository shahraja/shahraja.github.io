	<h1>Pengalaman Yang Menarik</h1>
	<h2>Jangan Nyesel Tapi Pas Bacanya</h2>
	<p>So when I was sleepy, when I was a baby I like to cry and even cry often, sometimes I like to defecate.
When I was no longer a baby, I became less crying often but occasionally, I didn't get defecated again but I was defecating on the toilet.
but sometimes it's too cepirit. As it grew older I was no longer crying and no more defecated. Enter elementary school normal life
I'm in grade 4 or grade 5, I like girls, human because I'm a man, if I don't like girls, after I graduate I go to junior high school
and one junior high school with a girl I like when I was in elementary school, and briefly my story invented with her, after that I broke up. After that up grade 8, and
dating again with the younger class, but it didn't last long. after that I went up to 9th grade I was dating too but the girl was like that. even though
I'm not very important, it's very important to know girls, but it's okay for this story to work, like me or not, my story that wrote me, huh? Next, after I graduated from my junior high school, I went to Vocational School, which is SMK 4 Bandar Lampung, I used to talk about girls, when I was in 10th grade I attended loma futsal, I was in vocational school taking part in futsal extracurricular because, further when I race I know someone woman which makes me happy and smiling every time I see him, he is like an angel who came down from heaven for me, after that I dated the "angel" which I named "squishy" and did not last long too, but I still have a sense of "nymph squishy "</p>
